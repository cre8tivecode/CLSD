	<h3>Welcome to Creative Life Skills Development</h3>
	<p>Creative Life Skills Development offers home based therapy services to children ages 0-21 with special needs throughout Arizona.  Our goal is to provide therapy in the setting that best suits the child and the family to create a “win-win” situation.</p>

	<h3>A message from the President of CLSD Therapy</h3>
	<h4>Dear friends,</h4>
	<p>Thank you for taking time out of your busy life and investing it here at our website.  <a href="./logo_files/logo.html">www.clsdtherapy.com</a> was created for multiple reasons.  First, I wanted a website that had many resource tools for parents of children with special needs so that they would not have to spend as much time “surfing” the web to find important information, events, groups, etc.  With that being said, if you find or know of something that relates to our services and would like us to share it, please do not hesitate to contact me about posting on this website.  My second intention for this website was to simplify a therapist’s responsibilities outside of the direct 1 on 1 therapy time.  In doing so, this site decreases both the amount of time needed to prepare for an appointment as well as completing necessary tasks after an appointment.  The result being, therapists can spend quality time with your child.  </p>
